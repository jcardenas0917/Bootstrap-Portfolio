          <p>My Name is Jaime Cardenas, I was born in Ecuador and came to the US when I was 12 years old. I
            lived in NJ for 17 years
            and moved to FL when I was 25 years old. I was in sales for about 10 years until I opened my own business
            repairing computers and cellphones
            for 5 years.<br>
            I have a wife and a 10 month daughter who is my world. Currently I work as the IT specialist for MasterCorp
            Inc at their Corporate office
            in Orlando and working on moving to the Developing Team.<br>
            I have been training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for 8 years, currently I'm a brown belt and a few years away from
            becoming a black belt.<br>
            If I'm not spending time with my family or working I'm definitely coding or training. My Goal is to become a
            Senior Developer at
            my company.</p>
