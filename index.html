  <img id="bio-img"src="./assets/images/jaime.jpg" alt="Jaime Cardenas" height="200" width="200">
  <p id="p1">My Name is Jaime Cardenas, I was born in Ecuador and came to the US when I was 12 years old.  I lived in NJ for 17 years
      and moved to FL when I was 25 years old.  I was in sales for about 10 years until I opened my own business repairing computers and cellphones
      for 5 years.<br>
      I have a wife and a 10 month daughter who is my world.  Currently I work as the IT specialist for MasterCorp Inc at their Corporate office
      in Orlando and working on moving to the Developing Team.<br>
      I have been training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for 8 years, currently I'm a brown belt and a few years away from becoming a black belt.<br>
      If I'm not spending time with my family or working I'm definitely coding or training.  My Goal is to become a Senior Developer at
      my company.</p>
